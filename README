fontmfizz -- Vector Icons for Technology and Software Geeks
Version: 2017/03/19

Font Mfizz provides scalable vector icons representing programming languages,
operating systems, software engineering, and technology.
The included "font-mfizz" free font is designed by MFizz Inc, Joe Lauer and
released under the open The MIT License (available at
http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). See http://mfizz.com/oss/font-mfizz for
more details about the font itself.

This package requires the "fontspec" package and either the Xe(La)TeX or
Lua(La)TeX engine to load the included ttf font.

Once the package is loaded, icons can be accessed through the general \mficon
command, which takes as argument the name of the desired icon, or through direct
commands specific to each icon. The full list of icon designs, names and direct
commands is showcased in the manual.
